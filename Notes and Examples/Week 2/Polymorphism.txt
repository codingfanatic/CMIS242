Polymorphism
See fig 2-5, and the TestPolymorphism class for more details

-One method call may invoke different overridden methods depending upon the actual type 
 of the object calling the method
--Notice that at run time, the overridden methods are resolved depending on 
  the type of the object, not the type of the reference.

See fig 2-5, and the TestPolymorphism class for more details.
